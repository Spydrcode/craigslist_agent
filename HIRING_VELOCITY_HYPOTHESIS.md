# The Hiring Velocity Hypothesis

## Core Insight: Active Hiring = Desperate for Help

### **The Hypothesis**

Companies posting **multiple active job listings** are the BEST prospects because:

1. **They're Growing Rapidly**
   - Can't grow fast enough with current team
   - Need immediate help

2. **Budget is Approved**
   - Headcount = money already allocated
   - They WILL spend to solve the problem

3. **They're Desperate**
   - Posting multiple jobs = can't find enough people
   - Willing to pay for external help

4. **They Have Urgency**
   - Can't wait months to hire and onboard
   - Need solutions NOW

## Scoring System (Velocity-First)

### **Job Count = Primary Score (70% of total)**

| Jobs Posted | Score | Status | Prospect Quality |
|-------------|-------|--------|------------------|
| **10+** | 70 pts | 🔥🔥🔥 **EXTREMELY DESPERATE** | Will pay anything for help |
| **7-9** | 60 pts | 🔥🔥 **VERY DESPERATE** | Urgent need, ready to buy |
| **5-6** | 50 pts | 🔥 **DESPERATE** | Clear growth, needs services |
| **3-4** | 35 pts | ⚡ **GROWING** | Starting to scale |
| **2** | 15 pts | 🤔 **MAYBE** | Weak signal |
| **1** | 0 pts | ❌ **SKIP** | Not growing |

### **Supporting Signals (30% of total)**

These are secondary - they help, but hiring velocity is king:

- **Technical Debt** (15%): "legacy", "migrate", "modernize"
- **Growth Keywords** (10%): "funded", "scaling", "startup"
- **Tech Stack** (5%): React, AWS, Kubernetes, etc.

---

## Why This Works

### **Example: Company A**
- **12 active job postings**
- Posting for: Backend, Frontend, DevOps, QA, Data, etc.
- Mentions "scaling rapidly"

**Analysis:**
- 12 jobs = 70 points (EXTREMELY DESPERATE)
- Growth keywords = 10 points
- **Total: 80+ = 🔥 HOT LEAD**

**Why pursue:**
- They can't hire fast enough
- They're spending $1M+ on salaries
- They'll gladly pay $50-100K for help
- URGENT need = quick decision

---

### **Example: Company B**
- **1 job posting**
- "Looking for a developer"
- No other signals

**Analysis:**
- 1 job = 0 points
- **Total: 0 = ❌ SKIP**

**Why skip:**
- Single job = no growth pressure
- Probably just replacing someone
- No urgency, will be slow to decide
- Low budget

---

## The Math: Why It Works

### **Hiring Costs vs. Service Costs**

**Company hiring 5 engineers:**
- 5 engineers × $150K salary = $750K/year
- Hiring time: 3-6 months
- Onboarding time: 3-6 months
- **Total cost + delay: $1M+ and 6-12 months**

**Alternative: Buy our services:**
- One-time project: $50K - $100K
- Delivery time: 4-8 weeks
- **Immediate impact**

**Value proposition:**
- 10x faster than hiring
- 10x cheaper than salaries
- Solves problem NOW

**Companies hiring 5+ people will gladly pay this.**

## First Scan Strategy

### **Phase 1: Quick Scan (5 seconds)**
Scan ALL jobs, just get:
- Job title
- URL
- Company name (extracted from title/location)

**Goal:** Find ALL companies with 3+ active jobs

### **Phase 2: Group & Count (1 second)**
Group jobs by company name
Count jobs per company

**Output:** Ranked list like:
1. TechCorp: 15 jobs 🔥🔥🔥
2. StartupX: 8 jobs 🔥🔥
3. GrowthCo: 5 jobs 🔥
4. ScaleUp: 3 jobs ⚡
5. ... (rest with 1-2 jobs = skip)

### **Phase 3: Deep Analysis (2-3 min)**
ONLY for companies with 3+ jobs:
- Fetch full job descriptions
- AI analysis for pain points
- Tech stack extraction
- Generate outreach

---

## Qualifying Metrics (In Order)

### **1. Job Count (70%)**
**Must have 3+ jobs minimum**

This is non-negotiable. Without multiple jobs, they're not growing fast enough to need help.

### **2. Technical Debt (15%)**
Look for keywords in job descriptions:
- "legacy system"
- "modernize"
- "migrate"
- "technical debt"
- "scaling issues"

**Why:** These are problems we can solve

### **3. Growth Stage (10%)**
Look for keywords:
- "startup"
- "funded"
- "series A/B/C"
- "scaling"
- "expanding"

**Why:** Growing companies have budget

### **4. Tech Stack (5%)**
Modern tech = sophistication:
- React, Vue, Next.js
- AWS, GCP, Azure
- Kubernetes, Docker
- Microservices

**Why:** Modern companies understand value of external expertise

---

## Disqualifiers (Auto-Skip)

Even if they have many jobs, skip if:

1. **Staffing/Recruiting agency**
   - They're not the end client
   - Just posting jobs for others

2. **Non-tech company**
   - Restaurant chain hiring "web developer"
   - Low tech sophistication

3. **Spam indicators**
   - "Make money from home"
   - "No experience needed"
   - MLM keywords

---

## Success Metrics

### **What to Track:**

1. **Conversion by Job Count**
   - How many companies with 3-4 jobs convert?
   - How many with 5-6 jobs convert?
   - How many with 7+ jobs convert?

2. **Deal Size by Job Count**
   - Do companies with more jobs buy bigger projects?

3. **Time to Close**
   - Do companies with more jobs decide faster?

### **Expected Results:**

| Job Count | Conversion Rate | Avg Deal Size | Time to Close |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| 10+ | 30-40% | $100K+ | 2-4 weeks |
| 7-9 | 20-30% | $75K+ | 4-6 weeks |
| 5-6 | 15-20% | $50K+ | 6-8 weeks |
| 3-4 | 10-15% | $30K+ | 8-12 weeks |
| 1-2 | <5% | <$20K | >12 weeks |
